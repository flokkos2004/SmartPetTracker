**Installation üì≤**
Clone or download the project from GitHub.

Open it in Android Studio.

Connect your Android device (or use an emulator with Google Play Services).

Set up your Google Maps API key in AndroidManifest.xml.

Run the project!

**Requirements üõ†**
Android 8.0 (API level 26) or higher

Bluetooth support for SmartTag tracking

Location Services (GPS) enabled

Firebase Realtime Database configured (optional but recommended)

**Permissions üîê**
The app requires the following permissions:

ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION: To track live location.

BLUETOOTH_SCAN and BLUETOOTH_CONNECT: To detect and connect to SmartTag.

ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION: For Bluetooth LE scanning.

POST_NOTIFICATIONS: (Android 13+) To send geofence exit notifications.

‚ö†Ô∏è Permissions are requested dynamically at runtime.

**Firebase Setup ‚òÅÔ∏è**
If you want to store and load path history from the cloud:

Go to Firebase Console.

Create a new project.

Add an Android App to the project and download the google-services.json file.

Place the google-services.json file inside your project's app/ folder.

Enable Realtime Database in Firebase Console.

Set basic rules for development (example):
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": true,
    ".write": true
  }
}
‚ö†Ô∏è Only for development. In production, set proper authentication and security rules.

Add Firebase dependencies in build.gradle.kts (already included in this project)

**How It Works üöÄ**
When the app starts, it tries to find and connect to a SmartTag nearby.

The app continuously tracks the pet's position using GPS.

If the pet moves outside the geofence, the app sends a notification.

You can save the recorded path to Firebase or export it locally.

You can select any past day to view, download, or export historical path data.
